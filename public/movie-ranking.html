<h1>The Best Movies According to Danny </h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time! </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Zombieland</h3>
<p>Zombieland is a great movie to put on when having a hangout day with the boys.</p>
<h3>Princess Monokoe</h3>
<p>Personally one of my favorite Studio Ghibili films of all time. It has great character development and graphics</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>A master piece that is just constant action and depicts the wild wild west lifestyle.</p>
