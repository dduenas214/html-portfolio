<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Duenas and I am currently a computer science major. I am attending SFSU full time. I am very passionate about problem solving and getting that satisfaction when doing so. I am mostly focusing on front end development since i do have the eye for design and what users will like to see.
